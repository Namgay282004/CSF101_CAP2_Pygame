This repository contains a Pygame project along with test cases performed using `pytest`.

## Project Overview

The Pygame project in this repository is designed to [brief description of your Pygame project]. It includes functionalities such as [mention key features or gameplay mechanics].

## Getting Started

To run the Pygame project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Namgay282004/CSF101_CAP2_Pygame.git

    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    # Ensure you have Python and pip installed
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the Pygame project:
